<p> This page is a 'list' view of a demo/test group of people called 'users'; it was built using Python, Flask, and Jinja templates. It can serve a large list (as a table) of test data from a JSON file with links to individual users, and it contains no 'real' user data, as it was generated automatically by third party APIs.</p>
